Question Techniques – Open/ Closed Question Variability (Open• Close-Close )
• No compounded questions! (eg do you do A and B?)
• No repeating stock phrases (eg I am sorry for your…)
• Range and depth – Chief complaint (5 points) + Comorbids (3 points)
• Tonality, Prosody, Rate of speech, Emphasising Key Point
• Show you have a range of affect eg Mirroring in the beginning proportionate to the patient’s affect then
calm in the middle and end.

Terms to know and about breastfeeding
MHRA = Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency- UK's FDA (drug regulator)
SUDEP = Sudden death in epilepsy patients (why can't stop valproate abruptly)
PPP = Pregnancy Prevention Programme (mandatory contraception + counseling for women on valproate)

MDT in this station = (psychiatrist + neurologist + obstetrician + pediatrician working together)
Two-specialist rule = Need 2 doctors to agree before starting valproate in anyone under 55
Annual Risk Form = Yearly form patient must sign showing they understand pregnancy risks
Fetal anomaly scan = 20-week ultrasound to check baby's development
Breastfeeding
“Sodium valproate/valproic acid passes into breast milk in very small amounts and does not usually cause any side
effects in breastfed babies. If your baby is healthy, you may be able to take sodium valproate/valproic acid while
breastfeeding. Your doctor may still recommend it if it’s the only medicine that works for you.” https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/valproic-acid/pregnancy-breastfeeding-and-fertility-while-taking-valproic-acid/

Language to use - Initial rapport
"Thank you for coming to see me today. I can imagine this situation might feel quite overwhelming, so I want you to
know that we'll work through this together and make sure you have all the support you need."
"First, let me understand what you already know about valproate and pregnancy…..
and what concerns you might have.” - ICE
[Listen to her response]

Setting the scene:
”Regarding valproate during pregnancy and while breastfeeding… if this is something you would like to consider?
Some of this might be concerning to hear, but I want to reassure you we'll find the safest path forward for both you
and your baby .” – Remember you must tell risks of valproate on pregnancy! So set the scene via Sandwhich approach

Language to use - Side effects and risks
USE Simple Terms:
"Birth differences" or "birth problems" instead of "congenital malformations"
"Learning and development challenges" instead of "neurodevelopmental disorders"

"Spine problem" instead of "neural tube defect" (only if specifically asked for details)
"Heart problem" instead of "cardiac anomaly”

Common reasons for failure
Don't overwhelm with medical details initially
Don't lead with percentages - start with understanding her situation
Don't create unnecessary panic about timing

Don't make decisions for her
Don't forget to address her emotional response

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Perinatal- Valproate
Language to use – Talking about number
Risk Communication to persuade her to STOP:
”If I have to put it in numbers: In the general population with women not taking valproate - about 2 to 3 babies out of
every 100 are born with some kind of birth problem. This is the risk that exists for everyone.
For women taking valproate during pregnancy, this risk increases to about 11 babies out of every 100 who might
have a birth problem.
Learning and development: In the general population, about 3 children out of every 100 might have learning
difficulties. For children whose mothers took valproate, this increases to about 30 to 40 out of every 100.”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Perinatal- Valproate
Language to use – Talking about number
Risk Communication if SHE IS WORRIED:
If 100 women taking valproate - about 11 of their babies might have a birth problem, and 89 would not have these
problems.
So while the risk is there, it's important to remember that most babies - about 9 out of 10 - don't have these
problems even with valproate."

7 weeks pregnant – Women Who Wants to Change
If she is upset that she didn’t know about these side effects:
"I can see you're upset about not knowing about these risks earlier, and that's completely understandable. Many
women haven't been given this information in the past, and that's not your fault."
"The most important thing now is that we act quickly to make things as safe as possible for you and your baby.”
Timing:
"You're 7 weeks pregnant, which means some of the very early development has already happened, but there's still
a lot of important development to come. Making changes now can still make a real difference."
"The baby's spine forms very early - in the first few weeks - and while that time has passed, other important
development continues throughout pregnancy. So reducing your exposure to valproate now is still very
beneficial."

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Perinatal- Valproate
7 weeks pregnant – Women Who Wants to Change
So what is oing to happen:
"Here's what we need to do to keep you both safe:

First, we cannot stop your medication suddenly - this could cause seizures or make your mood very unstable, which
would be dangerous for both of you.
Instead, we'll work with a team to gradually reduce your valproate while starting you on a safer medication. This
usually takes a few weeks.
I'll also start you on a high-dose vitamin called folic acid today - this helps protect against some of the risks.
We'll arrange extra scans during your pregnancy (18-20 weeks) to check how your baby is developing."

Acknowledging Her Perspective:
"I understand your concerns about changing a medication that's been working well for you. (Validate!) Your mental
health is important, and I want you to feel confident in whatever decision we make together."
"Let’s talk through what continuing would mean, and what support we could put in place.”
Balanced Risk Discussion::
"If we continue with valproate, the risks I mentioned would still be present (Explain the risks first!). However, we could
take steps to make things as safe as possible:
- Use the lowest dose that keeps you well
- Take high-dose folic acid
- Have extra detailed scans to monitor your baby's development
- Work closely with the obstetric team/ notify paediatrics and neurologist

Timing:
"At this stage of pregnancy - around [X] weeks - the time when major birth problems develop has mostly passed.
The main concerns now are about learning and development, which we can still influence."

Rapport
"Hello [Name], thank you for coming in today. I understand you're 12 weeks pregnant and have some concerns about
continuing quetiapine. Can you tell me what's been worrying you?"
[Listen to her diabetes concerns]
"I can see why reading about diabetes risks online would be concerning, especially during pregnancy. That's exactly
the kind of thing we will discuss today properly. (Set the scene here)"

"You mentioned this is your second pregnancy and you were on quetiapine before. How did that pregnancy go? Were
there any issues or concerns?"

Quetiapine – Gestational Diabetes
Risks-Plus-Monitoring
"It's actually really good that you've been thinking about this and doing some research. The internet can sometimes
be overwhelming though - there's a lot of information that needs to be put in proper context."
"What specifically did you read about quetiapine and diabetes that worried you most?"
About Gestational Diabetes- NEGATIVE INFO:
"You're absolutely right that there is some increased risk of gestational diabetes with quetiapine. Let me explain
what the research shows:
The normal risk of gestational diabetes in pregnancy is about 5-6 women out of every 100.
For women taking quetiapine, some studies suggest this might increase to about 8-10 women out of every 100.
So while there is an increase, it's important to understand that most women - about 90 out of 100 - who take
quetiapine during pregnancy do NOT develop gestational diabetes."

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Quetiapine – Gestational Diabetes

About Gestational Diabetes – PLUS INFO:
"The good news is that quetiapine is generally considered one of the safer antipsychotic medications in
pregnancy:
- It doesn't increase the risk of birth defects (the rate stays at the normal 3-5 out of 100 babies)
- Most women who take it have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies
- It's well-studied compared to some other psychiatric medications"

- It doesn't increase the risk of birth defects (the rate stays at the normal 3-5 out of 100 babies)
- Most women who take it have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies
- It's well-studied compared to some other psychiatric medications”

To Baby:
- Some babies might have temporary withdrawal symptoms after birth - things like being a bit jittery or having feeding
difficulties for a few days
- We might monitor your baby's growth a bit more closely, as some studies suggest babies might grow slightly larger
- Both of these are manageable and temporary if they occur"

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Quetiapine – Gestational Diabetes
Women Who DON’T Want to Change
"If you decide to continue with quetiapine, here's how we'd manage things to keep both you and your baby as safe as
possible:
Diabetes Monitoring:
- We'd test your blood sugar more frequently than usual
- You'd have a glucose tolerance test earlier than the standard 24-28 weeks, probably around 16-20 weeks
- If gestational diabetes did develop, it's very manageable with diet changes and sometimes medication

Medication Management:
- We'd use the lowest dose that keeps you well - what dose are you currently on?
- Regular check-ins to make sure your mental health remains stable
- We might need to adjust the dose as pregnancy progresses, as your body processes medication differently

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Quetiapine – Gestational Diabetes
Women Who DON’T Want to Change
Baby Monitoring:
- Extra growth scans to check baby's size
- Hospital delivery so baby can be monitored after birth

- Pediatric team aware in case baby needs extra support initially"
Benefit vs Risk Discussion:
"The important thing to remember is that keeping your mental health stable is crucial for both you and your baby.
Untreated mental health conditions can also carry risks:

- Increased stress hormones can affect baby's development
- Poor self-care, sleep, and nutrition
- Risk of postpartum mental health problems
For many women, the benefits of staying mentally well outweigh the small increased diabetes risk."

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Quetiapine – Gestational Diabetes
Women Who Want to Change
Alternatives
"If you're concerned about the diabetes risk, there are other options we could consider:

Aripiprazole - This might be a good alternative because:
- Lower risk of gestational diabetes
- Good safety data in pregnancy
- Effective for similar conditions to quetiapine
Other options- depending on your specific condition might include:
- Haloperidol (older medication, very well-studied in pregnancy)
- Olanzapine (though this also carries diabetes risk) – DON’T Mention if she doesn’t want to increase risk!

Quetiapine – Gestational Diabetes
Women Who Want to Change
Switching Process and Risks:
"If you wanted to switch medications, here's what that would involve:
The Process:
- Gradual reduction of quetiapine over 1-2 weeks
- Starting the new medication at the same time
- Close monitoring during the transition

Potential Risks of Switching:
- Temporary worsening of your mental health symptoms
- Sleep disturbance during the change
- Small risk that the new medication might not work as well for you
- Some adjustment time while we find the right dose
Timeline:
- The switch would take 2-4 weeks to complete
- You'd need very close monitoring during this time
- May need input from your partner or family for support"- Support
MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Quetiapine – Gestational Diabetes
End – Just pick whats relevant…don’t say everything
"Based on what we've discussed, here's what I suggest we do:
Immediate Actions:
- Start more frequent blood sugar monitoring
- Book early glucose tolerance test for around 18-20 weeks
- Continue your current dose of quetiapine for now
- Schedule review appointment in 2 weeks

Ongoing Plan:
- Monthly mental health reviews
- Extra obstetric scans at 28, 32, and 36 weeks
- Plan hospital delivery with pediatric support
- Review our plan if your mental health changes or if you develop diabetes
Decision Timeline:
- You don't have to decide about switching today
- If you want to change medications, sooner is better than later
- We can always reassess if circumstances change"

Acknowledging His Fears:
"I imagine this might sound quite scary - the idea of touching things and not washing your hands probably feels
overwhelming right now."
"That's a completely normal reaction. Most people with OCD feel anxious when they first hear about ERP."
"The important thing to understand is that this is done very gradually, at a pace you can manage."

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

ERP/ SD
Cognitive part!
General:
"Let's talk about the 'cognitive' part first - that's about the thoughts and beliefs that drive your behaviour.”
"The cognitive part of CBT helps you recognise these thought patterns and learn to think about them differently."
"Your therapist will help you identify your specific thoughts and examine the evidence for and against them."
"For example,
-OCD: if you think 'If I don't wash my hands, I'll definitely make someone sick,' you'd look at the actual evidence - how
many times has not washing immediately actually led to someone getting sick?”
-SD: identify and change the worried thoughts - like 'If I go out, I'll have a panic attack and won't be able to cope' - and
replace them with more realistic thoughts.”
Thought Record:
"You might keep what's called a 'thought record' - writing down your OCD thoughts and examining how realistic they
are."
"This helps you step back and look at your thoughts more objectively, rather than being caught up in them.”
Uncertainty Training:
learning to tolerate uncertainty.

5. Invite into therapy again: “Look into this with your therapist to break the cycle for future relationships?”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Transference- What if she wants to leave after months of therapy?
Link to the therapy relationship and her history of abandonment (You want to show you’ve made the connection with her father)
“After seeing someone every week for nine months, it’s very normal to feel attached to them in some way, even if sessions are
sometimes difficult.”
“You’ve also told me your dad left when you were young. I’m wondering whether your therapist going away might have touched
some of those old feelings of being left or not important. Does that ring true for you?”

If she responds:
“So it feels a bit like, ‘people go away just when I start to rely on them.’ That would make it very hard to want to go back.”
Explore avoidance, control and fear of needing someone -not “lecturing.”
“Sometimes, when old feelings of being abandoned get stirred up, it can feel safer to end the relationship yourself rather than risk
being hurt again.”
“I’m wondering if deciding to stop therapy now might also be a way of staying in control: ‘I’ll leave before she has the chance to leave
me again.’ How does that idea sit with you?”

CBT Psychosis
Formulation
"Based on what you've told me, let me share my understanding of what might have made you unwell, and see if
this makes sense to you:

Vulnerability Factors:
- You had some background vulnerability, possibly including [family history/early experiences/developmental factors]
- This meant you were at slightly higher risk of developing psychosis than someone without these factors
Triggering Factors:
- Around the time you became unwell, you were dealing with [specific stressors]
- The cannabis use may have contributed - we know it can increase psychosis risk, especially in people who are
already vulnerable
The Psychotic Episode:
- When these stresses combined with your background vulnerability, your brain's way of processing information
became disrupted
- This led to the experiences of [specific symptoms], which understandably were very frightening

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

CBT Psychosis
Formulation
Maintaining Factors:
- What might be keeping you at risk now includes ongoing cannabis use
- Stress about the diagnosis itself and its impact on your future
- [Any ongoing social or psychological factors]”

CBT Psychosis
CBT for Psychosis
Insight and Motivation:
- What are your goals for your recovery?
- How motivated do you feel to work on understanding and managing your experiences?
- What would you like to change or improve in your life right now?”
Engagement:
- Would you be able to commit to weekly sessions over several months?

- How do you feel about the idea of 'homework' or tasks between sessions?
Substance Use Impact (If not asked earlier):
- You mentioned you still smoke cannabis sometimes - how much and how often?
- Have you noticed it affects your symptoms or mental state?
- How motivated are you to reduce or stop cannabis use?"

CBT for Psychosis
"Based on our conversation, I think CBT for psychosis could be helpful for you. Let me explain what this involves:
- It helps you develop ways of understanding and coping with any ongoing unusual experiences
- We work on strategies to reduce distress
- We also look at stress management / relapse prevention
"From what you've told me, I think you could benefit from this approach because:

- - You're able to talk about your experiences openly
- - You seem motivated to work on your recovery
- - Your symptoms are reasonably stable on medication
Couple of things we'd need to work on:
- The ongoing cannabis (as coping mechanism) use could interfere with therapy progress
- We'd need to make sure your symptoms stay stable enough to engage with the sessions

Level 1: "Growth" or "Abnormality"
"Mrs Green, the CT scan shows an abnormal growth in your father's brain. This growth is what's been causing his
confusion and memory problems."
[PAUSE - assess her reaction]
"The growth is quite large and is located in the part of the brain that controls memory and thinking."
Level 2: If She Asks "What Kind of Growth?" → "Tumour"
"The growth appears to be a tumour - that means abnormal cells that have grown into a mass in the brain tissue."

Hyperprolactinemia

• Scenario: Jane Smith, 25, has a 4-year history of
schizophrenia and is taking olanzapine 20 mg daily. She
has developed milky breast discharge (galactorrhoea).
Her GP checked serum prolactin: 2,650 mIU/L. She
attends clinic today to discuss the result.
• Task: Take a focused history, explain the blood
results, and devise a holistic management plan with
her.

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Hyperprolactinemia
Focused history
A. Clarify her symptoms
“Jane, I understand you’ve noticed some milky discharge from your breasts.
Can you tell me when that started and how often it happens?”
“Any breast pain, lumps, or changes in shape or skin?”
“Any headaches or problems with your eyesight, like blurred or double vision?”
[Warning shot-sensitive questions]- Or you can proceed after asking impact. And if she mentioned her relationship
being strained
“Any period changes : more irregular, lighter, heavier, or stopped?”
“Any hot flushes, vaginal dryness, drop in sex drive, or difficulty with arousal?”
B. Medication and adherence

“You’re on olanzapine 20 mg … are you taking it every day?”
“Any other tablets, the Pill, herbal remedies?”
“Have you ever missed doses or changed the dose yourself?”

“How has your schizophrenia been over the past months – any voices, suspicious thoughts, or relapses?”
“How important has olanzapine been in keeping you well, in your view?”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Hyperprolactinemia
Explain Results
Serum prolactin 2,650 mIU/L = significantly high.
“We did a blood test called prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone made in a gland just under the brain that normally helps
with breast milk in pregnancy and breast-feeding.”
“Your level is higher than normal, and that explains the milky discharge from your breasts.”
“One common reason for this is medication like olanzapine. It can ‘block’ the brain chemical dopamine and, as a side
effect, the prolactin hormone goes up.”
Reassure :
“This is a known side effect of antipsychotic tablets. High prolactin can have long-term effects if we ignore it, so it’s
good we’ve picked it up.”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Hyperprolactinemia
Risks if untreated
“If prolactin stays high for a long time, it can:
Interfere with your periods and fertility.
Affect your bones, making them thinner and more likely to fracture in later life.
Possibly increase the risk of breast and womb problems if left for many years.”

You don’t need to lecture about epidemiology-just show you know:
long-term bone health / fractures
possible breast cancer risk
menstrual / fertility issues.

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Hyperprolactinemia
Management
A. Check for other causes
“Although olanzapine is the most likely cause, we should check there isn’t anything else contributing.”
“We’ll repeat the prolactin level in the near future to track it.”
“We should also check your thyroid function and a pregnancy test, because thyroid problems and pregnancy can also
raise prolactin.”
“You mentioned headaches – we need the medical/neurology team to review these properly and decide if any brain
imaging is needed. Most of the time it’s the medication, but we don’t ignore headaches with high prolactin.”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Hyperprolactinemia
Management
B. Options for managing the antipsychotic (shared decision-making)
Reduce the olanzapine dose
“We could very gradually reduce the olanzapine dose if your mental state allows. Sometimes even a small reduction
lowers prolactin.”
Switch to a more prolactin-sparing antipsychotic (e.g. aripiprazole)
“Another option is to slowly switch you from olanzapine to a medicine like aripiprazole, which doesn’t usually raise
prolactin and can even bring it down.”
Add low-dose aripiprazole to your current olanzapine
“A third option is to keep you on olanzapine, because it’s working for your schizophrenia, but add a small dose of
aripiprazole.
Research shows that adding aripiprazole can lower prolactin and improve symptoms like galactorrhoea, while keeping
psychosis under control.”
“This sometimes works quite quickly, over weeks to a few months.”
MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Hyperprolactinemia
Management
C. Broader physical and psychosocial care
“We’ll:
Involve your GP and possibly the medical team to look at your bone health in the longer term (e.g. considering vitamin
D, calcium, maybe a DEXA scan later if indicated).
Offer support or counselling if you wish- eg for relationship issues.”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Hyperprolactinemia
Management – Most important bit throughout- collaboration
“You’ve heard a lot of information. What are your thoughts about the options?”
“How worried are you about the breast discharge and long-term risks compared with your worry about your mental
health being stable?”
“Would you lean more towards adjusting the olanzapine dose, adding something like aripiprazole, or planning a
gradual switch?”
Then end with a recap and to

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Fluoxetine/ Suicidal
Likely Questions
"I read that antidepressants can make teenagers suicidal - why would you give this to someone who's already
depressed?”
You're right that there can be a small increased risk of suicidal thoughts in the first few weeks of treatment in teenagers
- about 4 out of every 100 young people might experience this.
Severe depression itself carries a much higher suicide risk. Without treatment, David's risk of self-harm or suicide is
much greater than the small increased risk from the medication.
Mataphor: if someone has a dangerous infection, antibiotics might cause some side effects, but the infection itself is
far more dangerous if left untreated.
"But he was admitted because of depression - doesn't that mean the medication isn't safe?”

"Actually, the fact that David needed admission tells us how severe his depression is, which is exactly why medication
becomes more important. Severe depression like David's has about a 15-20% risk of suicide attempts without
proper treatment. The small temporary increase in risk from medication - about 4% - is much smaller than the
ongoing risk from untreated severe depression.
We admit young people partly so we can monitor them very closely during those first few weeks when starting
medication, ensuring their safety while the treatment starts to work."

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Fluoxetine/ Suicidal
Likely Questions
"How will I know if the medication is making him worse?”
We look for warning signs including:
- Increased agitation or restlessness in the first 2-3 weeks

- New thoughts about self-harm or suicide
- Severe mood swings or increased impulsivity
- Difficulty sleeping or increased energy without mood improvement
This is why we have very close monitoring - daily checks while he's in hospital, then frequent appointments after
discharge.

"Why can't he just have talking therapy? Surely that's safer than drugs?”
"Talking therapy is absolutely important, and David will be getting that too. But let me explain why we need both
approaches for severe depression:
For mild depression, talking therapy alone is often the first choice. But David's depression is severe enough to need
hospital admission, which puts him in a different category.

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Fluoxetine/ Suicidal
Likely Questions
"Can't we just wait and see if he gets better naturally?”
"I understand the appeal of waiting - it feels like the safest option. But with severe depression, waiting can actually be
the riskiest choice:
- Severe depression can worsen without treatment
- The longer it lasts, the harder it becomes to treat
- It affects his brain development, school, friendships, and self-esteem
- Most importantly, it carries ongoing suicide risk
"I don't want to put chemicals in my child's developing brain. Won't this affect how his brain grows?”

Depression itself affects brain development - it can actually slow normal brain growth and development during these
crucial teenage years.
Fluoxetine works by helping the brain's natural chemical messengers (serotonin) work more effectively. It doesn't add
foreign chemicals - it helps restore the natural balance that depression has disrupted.

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Fluoxetine/ Suicidal
Likely Questions
"What about long-term effects? Will he be dependent on medication forever?”
"Most teenagers who recover from depression don't need long-term medication. The typical plan is:
- Medication for 6-12 months after David recovers

- Gradually reduce and stop the medication under medical supervision
- Continue with therapy skills for ongoing protection
The goal is always to help David develop his own coping skills and resilience so he can maintain his mental health
naturally.

Angry MotherClozapine

• Scenario: Talk to the angry mother of a male
schizophrenic patient, Mr. John, who has been an
inpatient for the last 3 months. He has been treated
with Clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
Prior to admission, he had been living with his
alcoholic brother in squalid circumstances and was
likely exploited financially. He had deranged liver
function tests at the time of admission, but his blood
tests have been fine for the last 3 months. She is
angry because she read on the internet that Clozapine
suppresses bone marrow. His response to treatment
has been slow, and he still needs prompting with
personal care. She is not happy about the care he
receives and would like to take him home. She lives 30
miles from the hospital with her husband, who is
also an alcoholic.
• Task: Address her concerns.
MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Clozapine
Likely Questions
"Why are you giving my son a drug that can damage his bone marrow?”
John has what we call treatment-resistant schizophrenia - his symptoms didn't improve with two other antipsychotic
medications we tried. Clozapine is the only medication proven to help people in John's situation.
The bone marrow risk affects about 1 person in every 100 who takes clozapine. That means 99 out of 100 people don't
have this problem. That's why he has regular blood tests. If there were any sign of bone marrow problems, we'd detect
it immediately and stop the medication. His blood tests have been completely normal for 3 months, which is very
reassuring.
"He's been here for 3 months and he's hardly any better! What are you people doing?”

Clozapine is different from other medications - it works more slowly but more effectively. Most people don't see
significant improvement until 3-6 months, and full benefits can take up to a year.
John actually IS making progress, though I understand it might not feel like much:
- His blood tests have completely normalized - his liver function is now fine
- He's safer here than he was in his previous living situation

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Clozapine
Likely Questions
"I want to take him home now. He'd be better off with me than in this place!”
- John still needs daily prompting for basic self-care
- He requires weekly blood monitoring for the clozapine to be safe

- His symptoms, while improved, aren't yet stable enough for independent living
"He was fine living with his brother before. Why can't he go back there?”
- His brother's drinking meant John wasn't getting proper support with medication or self-care
- The living conditions weren't suitable for someone recovering from serious mental illness
- John's liver problems suggested his physical health was suffering
We need to find John a living situation where he can be safe, take his medication consistently, and continue to recover.
That might be with family if we can put proper supports in place, or it might be supported accommodation.

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Clozapine
Likely Questions
"Are you sure he even has schizophrenia? Maybe you've got it all wrong!"
"I understand why you might hope there's been a mistake - no parent wants their child to have schizophrenia. Let me
explain why we're confident about the diagnosis:
John has had:
- Persistent auditory hallucinations (voices)
- Odd beliefs that affected his behavior
- Decline in his ability to care for himself
- Symptoms that have lasted for months, not just days or weeks

normal. His mother is angry to know from the nurses
that he has been diagnosed as having schizophrenia.
Ms. Linda Hill wants to seek clarification of her son's
diagnosis.
• Task: Address her concerns and allay her anxiety

Likely Questions
”It was wrong for the nurses to talk about his diagnosis in the hallway!”
Apologise for the experience – You will investigate what happened after their discussion with the nurses and take it
from there
"I've read that schizophrenia is caused by bad mothering. Is this my fault? What did I do wrong?”
"Absolutely not. That theory was completely discredited decades ago, but unfortunately it still causes unnecessary
pain to families.
What Actually Causes Schizophrenia:
- It's a brain disorder caused by a combination of genetic factors and environmental triggers

- About 1% of people develop schizophrenia regardless of their upbringing
- It affects families from all backgrounds - loving, supportive families like yours
- Good parenting doesn't cause it, and bad parenting doesn't cause it

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Schizophrenia
Likely Questions
"How can you be sure it's schizophrenia? He's only been here a few days!”
Peter has been experiencing symptoms for over 6 weeks:
- Hearing voices that others can't hear (auditory hallucinations)
- Unusual beliefs about lizards taking over the world (delusions)
- Bizarre behavior that's very different from his normal self
- These symptoms have significantly affected his ability to function at university
Why We're Confident:
- We've ruled out other causes - his blood tests and urine tests are normal, so it's not drugs or medical conditions

- The pattern and duration of symptoms fit the criteria for schizophrenia
Why Early Diagnosis Matters:
Getting the right diagnosis quickly means we can start the most effective treatment as soon as possible, which gives
Peter the best chance of recovery."

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Schizophrenia
Likely Questions
"Could it be something else? Maybe he's just stressed from university?”
Stress might cause anxiety, low mood, or sleep problems
- It doesn't typically cause persistent auditory hallucinations or elaborate delusional beliefs

- Peter's symptoms have continued even when removed from the university environment
However:
- Stress can sometimes trigger the onset of schizophrenia in someone who was already vulnerable
"Won't this diagnosis ruin his future? His career prospects? His chance of having a normal life?”
Many people with schizophrenia live full, meaningful lives
- They work, have relationships, get married, have children
- Early treatment, like Peter is getting, significantly improves outcomes
- There are legal protections against discrimination
- Many successful people have schizophrenia and live productive lives

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Schizophrenia
Likely Questions
"Should we keep this diagnosis secret? I'm worried about the stigma."
Unfortunately, stigma around mental illness still exists, but it's decreasing as understanding improves
- Many employers and institutions are much more understanding now

- There are strong legal protections against discrimination
My Suggestion:
- Start with close family and trusted friends who can provide support
- Peter can decide who else to tell as he gets older and more comfortable with his diagnosis
"What will people think of our family?”
- People who matter will be supportive and understanding
- You'll likely find you have more support than you expect
- Some people may surprise you with their kindness and shared experiences
- Peter is still the same person - intelligent, talented, with the same potential
- Your love and support matter more than anyone else's opinion"
MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Angry Mother- Schizophrenia
Likely Questions
"What does treatment involve? Will he need to be on medication forever?”
- Most people need medication for at least 2-3 years after their first episode
- Some people can eventually reduce or stop medication, but this must be done very carefully with medical
supervision
Other Treatments:
- Talking therapies like CBT for psychosis
- Family therapy to help everyone understand and cope
- Occupational therapy to help with practical skills

- Social support and rehabilitation programs

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Dissociative Stupor
Explaining Dissociative Stupor Diagnosis
"Based on Annie's presentation and what you've told me about recent stresses, I believe Annie is experiencing what we
call dissociative stupor."
"Dissociative stupor is a psychological response where the mind essentially 'switches off' as a way of protecting
itself from overwhelming stress or emotions."
"Her body is physically fine - that's why all the medical tests were normal. But her mind has temporarily disconnected
from her ability to respond to the world around her."
"It's not that she's choosing not to respond - her brain has automatically switched into this protective state without her
conscious control.”
Why it happens:
Usually happens when someone experiences stress or emotions that feel too overwhelming to process normally.”/
"It's actually a sign that Annie's mind is trying to protect her from something that feels too difficult to cope with.”/
"Some people are more prone to this kind of response, especially those who are sensitive or have difficulty expressing
difficult emotions."

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Dissociative Stupor
Concerns & Prognosis
"Is this mental illness?":
What Annie is experiencing is a psychological response to stress, but it's not a permanent mental illness.
"Many healthy, intelligent people can have dissociative episodes during particularly stressful times in their lives."

"This is more like a temporary protective mechanism that her mind has activated.”
"Will she get better?":
"The good news is that dissociative stupor typically resolves, often quite quickly once the underlying stress is
addressed."
"Most people recover completely with appropriate support and treatment."

"Annie is young and this appears to be her first episode, which are positive factors for recovery."

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Dissociative Stupor
Concerns & Prognosis
"How long will this last?":
"It's difficult to predict exactly, but dissociative episodes can last anywhere from hours to days, sometimes weeks."
"Once Annie feels safe and the underlying stress is managed, her mind should allow her to reconnect with her
surroundings."
About Not Eating/Drinking:
"I understand you're worried about her not eating or drinking. The medical team will ensure she stays physically safe
and hydrated while we work on the underlying cause."
"As her psychological state improves, her ability to eat and drink should return naturally."

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Dissociative Stupor
Management

Family Dynamics

• Scenario: Mr. Harding is the father of Gemma
Harding, a 15-year-old girl recently diagnosed with a
first episode of schizophrenia and now under the
care of the Early Intervention Service. Mr. Harding
and his wife have frequent arguments about how to
best support their daughter. He feels his wife is being
“too soft” on Gemma, while he believes that Gemma
should be encouraged to resume normal activities,
like returning to school and socializing. These
differences have caused tension in the family.

the family dynamics that may affect Gemma’s
progress. Do not discuss family therapy.

Family Dynamics

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Family Dynamics

High Expressed Emotions:
“Mr. Harding, I understand that you and your wife want the best for Gemma, but sometimes when there are strong
emotions at home—whether it’s [quote from what the father said eg. trying to push her to engage more, or even being too
protective]—it can add extra stress for her. This is what we call ‘high expressed emotions.’ It’s not about blame, but when
there’s [ quote experiences between him and his wife eg. tension, arguments, or pressure], it can make it harder for Gemma
to manage her schizophrenia.
What can really help is finding a middle ground where she feels supported but not overwhelmed.
“Is it my fault she is like this?”:
Your intentions were good and you being here to change things is a bright step moving forward. Shows your commitment
towards her

Alcohol and Schizophrenia

• Scenario: Mrs. ….is a 38-year-old woman and the sister of Mr. …. .
Mr. … has a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia and has been on
Clozapine for several years. Unfortunately, their parents have both
died recently, and Mr. .. is now living alone in the family house. Their
parents had been his main carers until shortly before they died. Mrs.
… lives around a 2-hour drive from the house and has 2 young
children, so she is unable to provide regular care to her brother but
has been coming to see him when she can. She has been increasingly
worried about him as he has seemed low in mood and has told her
that he is drinking more than before. She is not sure how much he
has been drinking, but she has seen a lot of empty whiskey and beer
bottles around the house. He has been talking about people watching
him when he is out of the house, which is one of the symptoms he
had before, and she has noted that he has more Clozapine around
than he should, and he has said that he sometimes forgets to take it.

• Task: Please explain to the sister a formulation of the case and explain
the potential adverse effects of alcohol on her brother's physical and
psychological health.

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Alcohol and Schizophrenia

• Formulation:
Mr. …’s increased alcohol use appears to be his way of coping with the grief of
losing his parents . Living alone and feeling isolated may have contributed to his
low mood. His on and off use of Clozapine, combined with the alcohol, is likely
worsening his schizophrenia symptoms, as he is now experiencing paranoid
thoughts again.

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Alcohol and Schizophrenia

Physical Health Risks:
Liver Damage: Heavy alcohol use can lead to liver problems, which can affect how medications like Clozapine are
processed.
Clozapine Interactions: Alcohol can interact with Clozapine, increasing side effects like sedation and making it harder
for him to stay alert.
Increased Risk of Accidents: Drinking can impair his coordination and judgment, putting him at risk for falls or other
injuries.
Mental Health Risks:
Worsening of Schizophrenia Symptoms: Alcohol can exacerbate symptoms like paranoia, hallucinations, and
delusions, making it harder to manage his condition.
Mood Instability: Alcohol is a depressant and can worsen his low mood, increasing the risk of further depression or
suicidal thoughts.
