What are they looking for
• Formulation and Diagnosis:

to explain it in understandable language to the patient, including differential diagnoses if applicable. Your knowledge
base is crucial for this.
• Comprehensive History Taking:
Eliciting and exploring relevant symptoms and details in sufficient depth.
• Risk Assessment Skills:

Adequately identifying potential risks and integrating them into the consultation.
• Patient-Centered Approach:
ensuring the interaction does not cause undue emotional or physical distress. This includes showing empathy.
• Attention to Physical Health

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

General Structure
Introduction:

◦ Introduce yourself and your role clearly. (Dr-Mr/ First name- First Name)
◦ Rapport first, then agenda-setting
Initial Exploration (Open Questions):
◦ Begin by listening to the patient
◦ Allow the patient to freely share their thoughts and expectations.
Focused Inquiry (Closed Questions) – Funnel Shape (Open- Close- Super closed!):
• Once initial features are explored, signal to the patient that you will ask more specific questions- ASKING CONSENT
(e.g., "Would it be OK if I ask you some specific questions now?").
• Then, focus on specific details with targeted closed questions, if appropriate.
Ensure to explore all components of the TASK instructions thoroughly.

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

General Structure
Demonstrate Systematic Approach:

◦ Explain what you are doing and why
◦ Summarise aspects of the information collected to show you are collating and processing information, and to
check understanding with the patient. Use mini-summaries for active listening.
• Formulation and Diagnosis:
◦ Commit to a diagnosis or formulate the problem based on available information, stating it clearly and explaining it
to the patient in understandable language.
◦ If unsure, explain your plan to reach a definite diagnosis.
• Risk Assessment:
◦ Demonstrate adequate skills in risk assessment throughout the history taking.
• Patient Engagement and Rapport:
◦ Be mindful of language, ensuring it is empathetic and does not cause distress.
◦ Build rapport by checking on their emotional state and showing curiosity

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Biggest Mistakes in History Stations
Poor Listening Skills and Not Responding to Cues:
◦ fail to use verbal or non-verbal cues to increase understanding.
◦ asking questions but not listening or acting upon answers
Echo/rephrase important points
Respond to emotion (“That sounds really tough…”)
Special weapon: linking!

Formulaic or Disorganised Consultation Style:
◦ The consultation may appear disjointed or erratic, without a clear logical structure.
◦ Repetitive or multiple closed questions
◦ Using pre-prepared phrases that sound insincere or not tailored to the patient (e.g., "How does that make you
feel?")

Insufficient Depth or Significance of Findings:
Poor Language Use:
◦ Using jargon or technical terms without explaining them fully to the patient

Time Management Issues: Running out of time before completing all tasks or formulating
a comprehensive plan

5. Formulation
MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

OCD
Rapport
“How has things been since your baby was born 6 weeks ago? Get the baby’s name!)
"It takes courage to talk about these things"
"Many women experience changes in their thinking after having a baby”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

OCD
Obsession
"What’s the most upsetting thought that keeps popping up?”
"These thoughts about cleaning - how often do they come into your mind?"
"When you have these thoughts, how do they make you feel?"
"Do you find these thoughts difficult to stop or control?”
Specific Postpartum questions TOWARDS BABY:
"Are these thoughts focused on protecting your baby from harm?"
"Do you worry about germs / contamination affecting your baby?”

Look for ego-dystonic intrusive thoughts, distress about the thoughts themselves, and attempts at thought
suppression

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

OCD
Compulsion
"When you have these thoughts, is there anything you feel you must do?/ do to feel safe?"
"Can you walk me through what a typical cleaning routine looks like now?"
"How many times do you need to clean something before it feels 'right'?"
"If you try to stop cleaning, what happens?”
Specific Postpartum questions TOWARDS BABY:
"Does this cleaning involve baby bottles, toys, or equipment?” (Indirect harm to baby!)
"Have you been avoiding certain activities with your baby because of these worries?"
”What does your husband say about cleanliness / your baby's safety?” (Social circle)

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

OCD
Functional impact & Comorbids – 100% have comorbid mood disorders
"How much time each day do you spend on cleaning routines?” – “must be exhausting” (Energy)
"Has this affected your ability to care for/ enjoy time with your baby?” (Anhedonia)
"How has this impacted your relationship with your partner?”
“When that thought appears, how do you feel in your body?” (Panic Attacks)
Specific Impact Areas:
Mood: “How’s your mood been since baby was born? Was it similar before?” (depression/ anxiety- which came first?)
Sleep: "How are you sleeping - do the thoughts keep you awake?"
Social functioning: "Have you stopped seeing friends or family because of these worries?"

Self-care/ appetitie: "Are you able to look after yourself properly/ have meals regularly to get your strength/ What about
me time?"

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

OCD
What about HARM TO SELF and BABY?!
1) normalise, 2) elicit the critical content, and 3) ego-dystonic intrusive thoughts vs genuine intent
Self harm (Elicit):
“On the hardest days, have you ever thought of ending your own life?”
Baby harm (Normalise):
“Some mums picture something awful happening to the baby and feel horrified. Any thoughts like that for you?”
Ego dystonic vs ego syntonic (Differentiate):

“Do those thoughts ever feel so strong you might act, or are they always unwanted and you try to resist?”
Clinical reasoning- So these thoughts are shocking to you, you always try to push them away, and you’ve never come
close to acting on them / I’m asking because mums who are distressed by the thought rarely act on it
MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Ending Formulation:
“You’ve been dealing with [Obsessions] and [Compulsions] for [Timeline].”
Impact:
“These thoughts and behaviors are affecting your [e.g., work or social life].”

Any Relevant Risks:

ADHD- Child
Sounds easy- why not many score well?
Common Pitfalls
Assessment mistakes
Accepting vague descriptions without seeking specific examples

Missing comorbidity screening
Failing to assess functional impairment
Communication
Rushing through symptoms without validating parental concerns (You are speaking to a 3rd person!)
Failing to acknowledge parental expertise and observations (Collaborative Language)
Sounding check-listy/ too formuleic

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

ADHD- Child
Rapport/ Engagement
"Hello …….I understand you've been concerned about David.
As his mother, you know him better than anyone, so I really want to understand what you've been seeing at home.

those early months go with him? There may be patterns early on (Clinical Reasoning)."
"Has anyone in the family have had similar traits?”
When she mentions: "He's always been active"

Clinical Reasoning – Basically to say her son is not the devil!:
"From what you're describing ….the early activity levels, the struggles with milestones, and the family history of similar
patterns …. this helps me understand that David's difficulties likely have neurodevelopmental roots rather than
being purely behaviour to stress."

“You’ve been retired about six months now – how has that change been for you?”

“You mentioned worries about money. Can you tell me more about that?”
“Do you feel you genuinely don’t have enough money for food, or is it more a feeling of guilt about spending?”
“Have you ever skipped meals or bought less food because you feel you ‘can’t afford it’?”
If he gives clear, fixed, unrealistic beliefs (“we are bankrupt” despite adequate income):
“Has anyone (like your wife, bank, or pension office) told you anything different about your finances?”
“Even when they tell you that, do you still feel sure you are ruined financially?”

REMEMBER- WHY MOST FAIL!

You don’t need to chase every other possible delusion; with an elderly, slow patient and limited time, focus on:
whether his money belief is driving poor intake, and

whether it sounds fixed, unrealistic, and out of keeping with the facts (i.e. delusional guilt/poverty).

Summarise Symptoms: “From what you’ve told me, it sounds like since [you retired] you’ve been feeling low, drinking
more, worrying a lot about money, and eating much less.

One line management: We’ll need to do some physical checks and also think about ways to help your mood, your
drinking, and your worries about money.”

"It’s perculiar that you can be a passenger in the same car without problems. What do you think might be different
about being the driver versus passenger?”

tests haven’t found anything seriously wrong, the pain feels just as bad/worst because it’s
affecting your mood, sleep, work, and life with your family. What I’m hearing is that your
mind and body get stuck in a ‘pain loop’—pain leads to worry and stress, which then makes
the pain feel even more powerful. This is something we call ‘persistent pain’’—it’s not just
about physical damage, but also how the nervous system and thoughts play a central role.

• “From everything you’ve shared, it’s clear how much these worries about your appearance
have been weighing on you—how your mind keeps coming back to your eyes, and how
hard you’ve tried to cope or find reassurance, even from doctors. It’s not about flaws, but
about distress and feeling stuck in a loop that steals your confidence and your day-today joy. This is a real condition called body dysmorphic disorder. We can help—with support
focused on getting you your life back, not just changing your looks.”

• Summarise : Mr B, I can see the weight gain has been really upsetting for you, especially
since it’s changed how you feel about yourself and your health. I also understand why
you stopped your tablets, hoping it would help your weight. Since then, though, the voices
and difficult thoughts have come back, which must be hard to face again.
• What I’m hearing is that you want to feel well in your mind and in your body—without having
to choose between the two. I want you to know we have ways to help: we can look at different
medicines that don’t cause as much weight gain, and offer support with your diet and activity
if you’d like.
• Restart of treatment, and psychoeducation around weight-neutral options.

"Hello Mrs GG, I'm Dr X. Thank you for coming in today. I know these can be difficult things to discuss, so please take
your time."

Strategy in this station:When she hesitates: "I can see this might be uncomfortable to talk about. That's completely understandable - these
are very personal symptoms.” – get her to tell the symptoms
Normalise or Collaborative: ”Lets try to get to the bottom of why this is happening."
Validating impact: "It sounds like this has really affected your quality of life and relationships (if she tells you how).
That must be incredibly difficult."
Recognise and adapts to patient's shyness – Lower tone of voice

Prime the patient before discussing sensitive topics – “I have a few sensitive questions to ask…”

Elevated Prolactin in Schizophrenia
Results explanation
1. Give "Warning Shot" :
"Mrs GG, I'd like to discuss your blood test results with you. I'm afraid they show something that might explain the
symptoms you've been experiencing."
[PAUSE for 3-5 seconds - let her brace herself]
2. Start with What She Already Knows (you can skip this or use this chance to summarise what she says):
"You mentioned you've been having some changes with your periods and some discharge from your breasts. Your
blood test shows that one of your hormone levels is higher than we'd expect."
3. Explain Prolactin in Simple, Relatable Terms:
Option 1: "The hormone is called prolactin - it's the one that normally helps women produce breast milk when they
have a baby. Your level is 770, and the normal range is under 600."
Option 2: "Think of prolactin like a switch that tells your body to prepare for breastfeeding. Sometimes medications like
risperidone can turn this switch on when it shouldn't be.” (In Metaphors)

Option 3: "This explains why you've been having the breast discharge and why your periods have stopped - your body is
getting signals that you're preparing to breastfeed, even though you're not pregnant (Confirm before if she is!).”

4. Link to Medication in a Non-Alarming Way
"This is actually quite common with risperidone - it happens to about 7 out of 10 people who take it. The good news is
that we know what's causing it, and there are things we can do to help you."
5. Normalise and reassure (Optional)
"These symptoms - the missed periods, breast discharge, and changes in how you feel - they're all connected to this
hormone change. It's not dangerous, but I can understand how distressing it must be for you."

Red Flag Screening
a. "I'd like to ask you a few routine questions to make sure we have the full picture of how you're feeling."
b. "As part of my assessment, I always check for other symptoms that can sometimes go along with hormone
changes.”
Then ask:
✓ "Have you been getting any headaches recently?"
(Not: "Are you having painful/serious headaches?")
✓ "How has your vision been - any changes in what you can see?"
(Not: "Have you had any visual issues?")
✓ "Have you noticed any changes in how you feel generally - energy levels, temperature, that sort of thing?"
If She Reports Concerning Symptoms

"Tell me more about these headaches - where do you feel them, and are they different from headaches you've had
before?"
"I want to make sure these aren't related to the hormone changes we've found."

Open and normalise side-effects
“Hi Mr …, I’m Dr __. I understand you’ve been on fluoxetine for your depression and that you’re thinking about stopping
it.
I’d really like to understand what’s worrying you so we can decide together what to do. Is that okay?”

If he shows any signs of irritation/ shyness/ hesitancy
“Lots of people taking this kind of medication get side-effects, including some that can feel embarrassing to talk about.
Whatever it is, it’s very common and you won’t shock me.”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

SSRI sexual dysfunction
Get him to talk about sex!
1.Gently explore his reason for stopping (keep it open first):
“What have you noticed since starting fluoxetine that’s making you want to stop it?”
2.If he’s vague (leading statement): “Some people notice physical changes, some emotional, some to do with sleep,
appetite, or even sex. What have you noticed most?”

?3. (For the ultra difficult patient) Because he’s shy, you need to lead him there in a normalising way:
“One of the common things with fluoxetine is that it can affect sexual function.
Have you noticed anything like that?”
If he nods / partially admits:
“Can you tell me a bit more about what’s changed for you, in your own words?”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

SSRI sexual dysfunction

4. Clarify the sexual problems (enough for formulation)
Ask 2–3 focused questions, not an interrogation:
“Is it more:
Trouble getting or keeping an erection?
Trouble reaching orgasm, or orgasms feeling weaker?

Less interest in sex overall?”
“When did this start – was it after the dose went up to 40 mg, or before?”
“Are you in a relationship at the moment? How has this affected things between you and your partner?”
“How do you feel about it – is it causing you a lot of worry or embarrassment?”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

SSRI sexual dysfunction
Rule out other causes- Depression
Rule out other causes briefly
“Any problems like this before starting fluoxetine?”
“Do you drink much alcohol or use any drugs?”
“Any other medical conditions – diabetes, blood pressure problems, prostate issues?”
“Any other medications – for blood pressure, prostate, or anything else?”

Check how depression is doing
You need to show you’re balancing mood vs side-effects:
“How has your mood been recently compared to before starting fluoxetine?”
“Sleep, appetite, energy, concentration?”
“Any thoughts of harming yourself or that life isn’t worth living?”

MedPsychKH Crash Course- Dr.Praveen Kumar

SSRI sexual dysfunction

• Validate and explain clearly: “Thank you for telling me that – I know it’s not easy to talk
about. Fluoxetine and other SSRIs commonly cause sexual difficulties, especially at higher
doses. It doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you as a man – it’s a well-known effect of the
medicine.”
• Mx: “The good news is there are several options. We don’t have to choose between your
mood and your sex life – we can work together to find a balance.”
• Close collaboratively: “Would you be open to adjusting things rather than stopping
suddenly? We can decide together on the next step, but I’m really glad you told me about
this.”

Task: Address his concerns and explore why he wants to stop fluoxetine.
Obtain further history to identify the cause of his concerns.

Respond to cues (embarrassment, low self-esteem) with validation:
“A lot of people feel the same way. You’re not alone in this.”
